          <h2>Who am I</h2>
          <p>
            I am a 26-year-old student from HAMK University of Applied Sciences. I am studying for a Bachelor of
            Business Administration, and my field of study is computer science and telecommunications.
          </p>
          <h2>Roots</h2>
          <p>
            I was born and raised in Finland. To be exact, I spent my entire youth on the eastern side of Helsinki,
            where I made many friends, learned the basics of life, and finally met my future wife. When I started my
            studies at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, I moved to Hämeenlinna.
          </p>
          <h2>Education</h2>
          <p>
            I studied to become an electrician and baccalaureate in 2016 at the same time. I deepened my electrician
            studies in 2019 during the coronavirus pandemic. Finally, in 2023, I thought, "What would I REALLY like to
            do for a living?" After studying for a year at HAMK University of Applied Sciences, I think I have found the
            answer to this question.
          </p>
          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
            My career as an electrician began in 2016 after graduation and continued for 6 consecutive years, excluding
            my military service. I showed excellent initiative, robust professionalism, and a sense of responsibility. I
            quickly progressed to the role of site manager and formed a deep trust between the employer and the
            customers. When I decided to change professions, I had a good understanding of everything and much of it in
            practice.
          </p>
          <h2>Motivation</h2>
          <p>
            My family, of course. It includes my wife and our dogs, Uuno and Nasse. Of course, part of my motivation is
            my desire to advance in my career and my interest in the industry. I want to build a better world for the
            future.
          </p>
          <h2>Future</h2>
          <p>
            Speaking of future, my goal within five years is to be a strong expert in software development. At the end
            of the day, senior software developer is a title I'm going to work hard for and achieve. There is no
            question of that. Alongside my studies, I also obtained work permits that would allow me to work as a light
            entrepreneur as a electrician alongside my main career. This way, I can make the most of my years of
            experience.
